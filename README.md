## Solutions

| Day |  Code | Language | Status | Thoughts |
|-----|---|----------|--------|------|
| Day 1 | [Clojure](day1/day1.clj) [Python](day1/day1.py)     | Clojure/Python  |    ⭐⭐    | Bruteforce was good enough for part2 |
| Day 2 | [Clojure](day2/day2.clj)     | Clojure  |    ⭐⭐    | Go regex engine does not support back ref, back to clojure |
| Day 3 | [Go](day3/day3.go)     | Go  |    ⭐⭐   | |
| Day 4 | [Go](day4/day4.go)     | Go  |    ⭐⭐   | |
| Day 5 | [Go](day5/day5.go)     | Go  |    ⭐⭐  | |
| Day 6 | [Go](day6/day6.go)     | Go  |    ⭐⭐  | |
| Day 7 | [Go](day7/day7.go)     | Go  |    ⭐⭐  | |
| Day 8 | [Go](day8/day8.go)     | Go  |    ⭐⭐  | For part1, an attempt counts as a connection |
| Day 9 | [Go](day9/day9.go)     | Go  |    ⭐⭐ | Gave up on part2 solution and decided to study someone's else approach. I'll revisit this problem later. [EDIT: 10/12/2025] Part2 was the closest aoc problem to make me give up|
| Day 10 | [Go](day10/day10.go)     | Go  |    ⭐  |Changed the part1 solution from using slices to bitwise operations. Reduced the runtime significantly by only allowing each button to be pressed once. TODO: Solve part2 using z3|
